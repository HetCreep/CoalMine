description: >-
  Code-health scan — dead code, bug-prone logic, resource leaks, concurrency bugs, silent failures, input-boundary issues, doc rot. Triggers on: "/rot-canary", "rot-canary", "code-health" (legacy aliases: "/rotcanary", "rotcanary"). Auto-runs at session end on touched files (QUICK, report only) via platform hooks — auto-wired by the Claude Code plugin, manual elsewhere. Run manually for fix mode. Reports; fixes on request via choice-gated menu.

# Rot-Canary

**Language:** Generate EVERYTHING at runtime in the user's language — questions, answer options, menu labels, recommendations, report narrative. Detect from their messages; never default to English just because this file is English. English is allowed only for technical terms: commands, paths, code identifiers, severity labels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), and tier names (Light/Standard/Heavy).

Scan code for rot. Report CONFIRMED findings. Fix on request.

## Parameters
- **SCOPE:** touched files (default) | diff | named files | whole repo. Touched files scan uses hybrid capping (scans all if <= autoScanFileCap, otherwise caps at autoScanFileCapSlice most recently modified files and warns user).
- **DEPTH:** QUICK (default) | DEEP

## Categories
1. **Bug-risk** — null deref, wrong operator, off-by-one, missing return
2. **Dead / unreachable** — zero-ref symbols, code after return/throw, always-true guards
3. **Disconnected** — exists but never wired to entry point, half-done refactor
4. **Duplication** — copy-paste diverged, two sources of truth for one constant
5. **Resource leak** — undisposed handle/stream/COM, subscription never removed
6. **Async** — unawaited task, `.Result`/`.Wait()` deadlock, blocking on UI thread
7. **Silent failure** — empty catch, success on partial completion, ignored return code
8. **Input security** — unvalidated input, injection, path traversal, secret in code/log
9. **Performance** — O(n²) in hot path, N+1, unbounded growth, work on UI thread
10. **Doc rot** — comment contradicts code, stale TODO, wrong param in docstring

## Discipline
- Report only CONFIRMED. Unverifiable → separate "SUSPECTED" list.
- Cite evidence (file:line, call-site count, the absent catch).
- "Dead" = zero reachability via ALL routes (reflection, DI, events, public API, tests).

## Fix mode (choice-gated)

**Standing consent:** honor `.coalmine.json` `autoFixMode` as the pre-chosen option (the config IS the chosen option) — `off` = report only, no menu · `safe` = apply safe/reversible fixes automatically (still checkpoint → build/test → revert if red) · `interactive` (default) = present the menu below.

After any scan report in an interactive session — manual run OR hook-nudged auto-scan — you **MUST** present this menu via `ask_question` (skip only when findings are zero, no user is present, or `autoFixMode` pre-decided above):

- **Apply safe fixes:** mechanical, fully reversible edits only (dead imports, commented-out blocks, formatting). Each fix: checkpoint (git stash/commit) → apply → build + tests → auto-revert if newly red.
- **Let me pick:** list findings; user selects.
- **Report only:** exit unchanged.

NEVER auto-fix: live/reachable path · logic change · "API looks wrong" (ground via source-grounding first) · framework-wired code that only *looks* dead · SUSPECTED findings.

## Output
| # | path:line | category | severity | finding | evidence | fix |

Then: SUSPECTED list · coverage gaps · counts + top 3 to fix.

Severity: CRITICAL (data loss/security/crash on normal path) · HIGH (real bug/leak on reachable path) · MEDIUM (dead/dup/unwired) · LOW (style/doc rot)

## Cadence
Stop hook → auto QUICK on session's touched files (report only). To protect the token budget, the Stop hook applies a hybrid cap: if the number of touched files is <= autoScanFileCap (configurable in `.coalmine.json`), all files are scanned; if greater, the scan is capped at the top autoScanFileCapSlice most recently modified files, and a localized warning is displayed to the user. Manual whole-repo DEEP sweep when needed. Auto-wiring is platform-dependent — read `references/cadence.md` before claiming auto-scan works on the current platform.

## Tooling
Per-stack build/dead-code/lint commands: read `references/tooling.md` when selecting scan tools.

## Escalation — Scope & Model Quality

Tiers are **capability targets**, not platform commands — resolve each to your host's nearest lever. If your platform lacks a lever, **degrade gracefully: never fake parallelism you cannot do** — escalate via model tier + reasoning depth instead.

| Level | Intent | Capability target | Token Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Light** | Fast scan, minimal coverage | Cheapest/fastest mode · most economical model · single agent, no sub-agents. | Low |
| **Standard** | Balanced scan, module-level coverage | Balanced model · default/raised reasoning · focused sub-agents per category **only if your platform runs concurrent workers** (else stay single-agent). | Balanced |
| **Heavy** | Full scan, maximum coverage | Most capable model + largest context · deepest reasoning (max/xhigh) · maximum sub-agent fan-out **if supported** · adversarial cross-check where available. | High |

**Per-platform Heavy lever** (use your host's): Claude Code → Dynamic Workflows / `ultracode` (≤16 concurrent agents); OpenAI Codex → `xhigh` effort + subagents + Cloud `--attempts`; Cursor → Max Mode + Cloud Agents; Antigravity → Agent Manager + Planning Mode; Amp → deep mode + Oracle + subagents; GitHub Copilot → Cloud agent + high Thinking Effort; Goose → subagents + Goosetown; JetBrains → Junie Brave + Junie CLI. **No concurrent-worker fan-out** — single-agent at every tier, escalate by model + reasoning only: **Gemini CLI · Cline · Windsurf** (in-session).

**Agent Context (interactive):** score the tier rubric, then call `ask_question` once with the 3 tiers — the rubric's pick marked `✓`, score shown, labels localized — and wait for the user's choice before starting. `ask_question` = your platform's question tool: Claude Code `AskUserQuestion` · Cline `ask_question` · Copilot `askQuestions` · Gemini CLI `ask_user` · Codex `request_user_input` · Cursor/Windsurf/Antigravity built-in prompts; none → numbered text menu.

**Tier rubric (deterministic):** +1 each — ① >20 files or whole-repo/cross-module reach ② >2 of this skill's categories/dimensions/aspects relevant ③ release/security/pre-ship context ④ findings will drive code changes. **0–1 Light · 2–3 Standard · 4 Heavy.** **Freshness cap:** if the scope was already audited ≥Standard this session, cap the recommendation at Light regardless of the base score — re-auditing fresh ground wastes tokens; scope the run to what changed since. **Default tier:** honor `.coalmine.json` `defaultTier` (Light/Standard/Heavy) as the default on every route unless the user requests a tier for that run. An explicit user tier request always overrides everything.

**Hook Context (auto-triggered):** auto-Light, no tier question, no sub-agents — report first. If the session is interactive (a user is present), offer the fix menu after the report; truly non-interactive runs stay report-only. Never fix without a chosen option.

**Heavy durability:** run in short phases, reading results between them; if a run dies, recover finished sub-agent results from your platform's run records and re-spawn only what is missing. On Claude Code, fan out with the bundled `coalmine-scanner` agent (read-only, one dimension per spawn, table output).

**Self error-report:** if this skill itself misbehaves (contradictory instruction, broken procedure, wrong finding class), OFFER to file it at https://github.com/HetCreep/CoalMine/issues/new/choose with a summary the user has reviewed — never auto-submit, never include unapproved code or paths.

**Entanglement:** after delivering the report, if confirmed findings fall in another canary's domain, offer that canary once via `ask_question` (one line, max one offer): perf/N+1 → scale-canary · contract/serialization/config → drift-canary · failure-path/retry → resilience-audit · logging/metrics → telemetry-canary · coupling/DI → testability-canary · dependency/CVE → supply-chain-audit · unverified version-sensitive claim → source-grounding · missing/stale rule → gold-standard.
