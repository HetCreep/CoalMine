description: >-
  Software supply chain audit — dependencies (CVEs, maintenance, licenses, transitive risk), build/CI integrity (SHA-pinned actions, lockfile, CI-only release), artifact integrity (checksums, signing, SBOM). Triggers on: "/supply-chain-audit", "supply-chain-audit", "dependency audit". Run before adding a dep, before a release, or for periodic review. Reports; does not change deps unless asked.

# Supply-Chain Audit

**Language:** Generate EVERYTHING at runtime in the user's language — questions, answer options, menu labels, recommendations, report narrative. Detect from their messages; never default to English just because this file is English. English is allowed only for technical terms: commands, paths, code identifiers, severity labels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), and tier names (Light/Standard/Heavy).

Audit what the project trusts: deps, build pipeline, shipped artifact. Report; do NOT change deps unless asked.

## 1. Dependencies
- **Scope** — honor `.coalmine.json` `packageManifests` if set: scan exactly those manifest/lockfile paths; else infer by inspecting the repo.
- **CVEs** — run ecosystem auditor; cross-check every hit in GHSA/OSV/NVD. Cite advisory ID + affected range + fixed version. (Invoke source-grounding — never from memory.)
- **Maintenance** — last release, commit recency, bus-factor, archived/deprecated flag.
- **License** — flag copyleft inside permissive project, missing/unknown license.
- **Transitive** — full tree; name the parent to bump for a transitive fix.
- **Behavior** — phone home? install scripts? unexpected egress?

## 2. Build / CI
- CI-only release builds?
- Actions pinned to commit SHA (not floating tag)?
- Lockfile committed + enforced in CI?
- Minimal token scope? No `pull_request_target`?

## 3. Artifact
- SHA-256 checksums published for every binary?
- Signed (Authenticode/GPG)? Gap documented honestly?
- SBOM generated?
- User can verify before running?

## Tooling
Per-ecosystem vuln/license/outdated commands + offline fallback: read `references/tooling.md` when selecting scanners.

## Discipline
- Ground every CVE/fixed-version in an advisory. Never from memory.
- Don't auto-change deps — report + recommend; user decides (bumps break builds).
- State what was NOT scanned. Blocked network scans → lockfile inspection fallback (see `references/tooling.md`), mark live checks N-A.

## Fix mode (choice-gated)
After the report, present via `ask_question`:
- **Pin safe now** — commit already-present unchanged lockfile, pin CI action to current SHA, add missing checksum step. Each: checkpoint → apply → verify.
- **Let me pick** — user-selected fixes only.
- **Report only** — change nothing.

NEVER auto-fix: dep version bump, lockfile regen (re-resolves entire transitive tree).

## Output
`| package | direct/transitive | issue | severity | advisory | fixed-in | action |`
Build+artifact checklist · Summary (counts + top fixes) · Not scanned

## Escalation — Scope & Model Quality

Tiers are **capability targets**, not platform commands — resolve each to your host's nearest lever. If your platform lacks a lever, **degrade gracefully: never fake parallelism you cannot do** — escalate via model tier + reasoning depth instead.

| Level | Intent | Capability target | Token Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Light** | Single-section check, spot audit | Cheapest/fastest mode · most economical model · single agent, no sub-agents. | Low |
| **Standard** | Multi-section balanced audit | Balanced model · default/raised reasoning · focused sub-agents per category **only if your platform runs concurrent workers** (else stay single-agent). | Balanced |
| **Heavy** | Full 3-section audit + adversarial CVE verify | Most capable model + largest context · deepest reasoning (max/xhigh) · maximum sub-agent fan-out **if supported** · adversarial cross-check where available. | High |

**Per-platform Heavy lever** (use your host's, if it has concurrent fan-out): Claude Code → Dynamic Workflows / `ultracode` (≤16 concurrent agents); OpenAI Codex → `xhigh` + subagents + Cloud `--attempts`; Cursor → Max Mode + parallel Cloud Agents; Antigravity → Agent Manager; Amp → Oracle + subagents; GitHub Copilot → `/fleet` (Copilot CLI) + Cloud agent; Goose → subagents; JetBrains → Junie CLI; Gemini CLI / Cline (read-only) / Windsurf (now Devin) → subagents. **If your platform has no concurrent fan-out, escalate by model + reasoning only.** ⚠️ Subagent support CHURNS fast — most major agents added it through 2026 — so verify your platform's current capability rather than trusting any fixed list here.

**Agent Context (interactive):** score the tier rubric, then call `ask_question` once with the 3 tiers — the rubric's pick marked `✓`, score shown, labels localized — and wait for the user's choice before starting. `ask_question` = your platform's question tool: Claude Code `AskUserQuestion` · Cline `ask_question` · Copilot `askQuestions` · Gemini CLI `ask_user` · Codex `request_user_input` · Cursor/Windsurf/Antigravity built-in prompts; none → numbered text menu.

**Tier rubric (deterministic):** +1 each — ① >20 files or whole-repo/cross-module reach ② >2 of this skill's categories/dimensions/aspects relevant ③ release/security/pre-ship context ④ findings will drive code changes. **0–1 Light · 2–3 Standard · 4 Heavy.** **Freshness cap:** if the scope was already audited ≥Standard this session, cap the recommendation at Light regardless of the base score — re-auditing fresh ground wastes tokens; scope the run to what changed since. **Default tier:** honor `.coalmine.json` `defaultTier` (Light/Standard/Heavy) as the default on every route unless the user requests a tier for that run. An explicit user tier request always overrides everything.

**Hook Context (auto-triggered):** auto-Light, no tier question, no sub-agents — report first. If the session is interactive (a user is present), offer the fix menu after the report; truly non-interactive runs stay report-only. Never fix without a chosen option.

**Heavy durability:** run in short phases, reading results between them; if a run dies, recover finished sub-agent results from your platform's run records and re-spawn only what is missing. On Claude Code, fan out with the bundled `coalmine-scanner` agent (read-only, one dimension per spawn, table output).

**Self error-report:** if this skill itself misbehaves (contradictory instruction, broken procedure, wrong finding class), OFFER to file it at https://github.com/HetCreep/CoalMine/issues/new/choose with a summary the user has reviewed — never auto-submit, never include unapproved code or paths.

**Entanglement:** after delivering the report, if confirmed findings fall in another canary's domain, offer that canary once via `ask_question` (one line, max one offer): perf/N+1 → scale-canary · contract/serialization/config → drift-canary · failure-path/retry → resilience-audit · logging/metrics → telemetry-canary · coupling/DI → testability-canary · dependency/CVE → supply-chain-audit · unverified version-sensitive claim → source-grounding · missing/stale rule → gold-standard.
