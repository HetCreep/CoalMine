**Agent Context (interactive):** assess scope, then call `ask_question` once with the 3 tiers — mark the recommended one `✓` by judgment (never hardcoded), localize labels, and wait for the user's choice before starting. `ask_question` = your platform's question tool: Claude Code `AskUserQuestion` · Cline `ask_question` · Roo `ask_followup_question` · Copilot `askQuestions` · Gemini CLI `ask_user` · Codex `request_user_input` · Cursor/Windsurf/Antigravity built-in prompts; none (e.g. Goose) → numbered text menu.

**Hook Context (non-interactive):** auto-select Light. No questions, no fixes, no sub-agents — report only.

**Heavy durability:** chunk long multi-agent runs into short phases, reading results between them; if a run dies mid-way, recover completed sub-agent results from your platform's run records and re-spawn only the missing pieces.
